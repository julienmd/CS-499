              <h3>Introduction</h3>
              <p>
                Hello, my name is Julien Dorka, and I began my journey at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU) three years ago as a computer science major. Throughout this time, I’ve developed a strong foundation in software development, data structures, algorithms, and a variety of programming languages and tools.
                This GitHub Pages website serves as my electronic portfolio, showcasing key projects and accomplishments from my time in the program. It also highlights the final capstone project I completed for CS-499, marking the culmination of my studies and the final step toward earning my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science.              </p>

              <h4>Academic Reflection</h4>
              <p>
              Taking this course for my capstone project prompted me to think about the experiences and knowledge I have accrued in the last three years in SNHU’s Computer Science program. Right from the start of the course, I have been able to build upon important skills like reasoning, analysis, and general problem solving. This is, in a way, my preparation for understanding sophisticated coding techniques and the different phases of software engineering. As I get ready to enter my last term, I have a refined understanding of how this program has influenced my approach towards technology discipline alongside my work ethic.
              While polishing my final project artifacts, I concentrated on the visual and functional interfaces of the work, applying finishing touches to both sides. My focus was improving the user experience and polish my code so that it was not only compliant with standards, but fundamentally functional and easy to navigate. This required perfecting the looks, ensuring appropriate functionality and ensemble with project parameters, which is critical within software development lifecycle.
              For me, one of the lessons that stood out the most was the importance of considering different vantage points, particularly that of the end user. I have worked to enhance the user’s experience and made the interaction with my system to be as seamless as possible.  Whether I end up in a front-end development role, a user experience position, or something else entirely, the ability to anticipate user needs and design with empathy will remain central.
              Although my long-term goal is still tied to a career in aviation, computer science is a powerful backup plan—one that I’ve grown passionate about. The versatility of this degree has opened up countless doors and provided me with a skill set that will benefit me in nearly any industry. The ability to analyze data, write efficient code, and develop functional solutions is something I’ll carry with me regardless of where I land.
              Ultimately, this capstone has been more than just a final assignment. It’s been a culmination of everything I’ve learned: a showcase of not only my technical growth but also the mindset I’ve developed along the way. I'm proud of what I've built, and more importantly, how far I’ve come. </p>

              <h4>Refining selected artifacts</h4>
              <ul class="alt">
                <li>The artifacts presented in this portfolio represent key milestones in my academic journey, specifically in the domains of software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and database management. Each artifact has been carefully selected to demonstrate not only my technical proficiency but also my growth in problem-solving, attention to detail, and ability to build scalable, user-centered solutions.
                    Over the course of the capstone, I revisited and refined each project to improve functionality, usability, and maintainability. For the software design artifact, I restructured the application to follow best practices in modular programming and implemented additional features to enhance user interaction. In my algorithms and data structures artifact, I optimized performance by refining search and sorting algorithms, while also expanding the code’s ability to handle larger, more complex data sets. Lastly, for the database artifact, I improved CRUD functionality, normalized the schema for better efficiency, and integrated it with a front-end interface to showcase full-stack capabilities.
                    In addition to expanding the technical depth of each project, I incorporated thorough documentation and comments throughout the code to make it more understandable and accessible for other developers. These enhancements reflect my dedication to writing clean, efficient, and professional-quality code—skills that are critical for success in the software development field./li>
