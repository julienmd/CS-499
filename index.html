This required perfecting the looks, ensuring appropriate functionality and ensemble with project parameters, which is critical within software development lifecycle.
              For me, one of the lessons that stood out the most was the importance of considering different vantage points, particularly that of the end user. I have worked to enhance the user’s experience and made the interaction with my system to be as seamless as possible.  Whether I end up in a front-end development role, a user experience position, or something else entirely, the ability to anticipate user needs and design with empathy will remain central.
              Although my long-term goal is still tied to a career in aviation, computer science is a powerful backup plan—one that I’ve grown passionate about. The versatility of this degree has opened up countless doors and provided me with a skill set that will benefit me in nearly any industry. The ability to analyze data, write efficient code, and develop functional solutions is something I’ll carry with me regardless of where I land.
              Ultimately, this capstone has been more than just a final assignment. It’s been a culmination of everything I’ve learned: a showcase of not only my technical growth but also the mindset I’ve developed along the way. I'm proud of what I've built, and more importantly, how far I’ve come. </p>

              <h4>Refining selected artifacts</h4>
              <ul class="alt">
                <li>The artifacts presented in this portfolio represent key milestones in my academic journey, specifically in the domains of software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and database management.

              <h3>Code review</h3>

              <h4>Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering</h4>

              <p> In my CS330 OpenGL project, I successfully enhanced the visual and functional complexity by transitioning to Blender for advanced 3D modeling and texturing. This allowed me to incorporate more intricate and detailed geometry, significantly improving the realism of my workstation setup scene. By utilizing Blender’s powerful modeling tools, I was able to create complex objects and refined shapes that were not feasible with my earlier approach in OpenGL. 
                  To further elevate the project, I implemented high-resolution textures and applied sophisticated rendering techniques such as ambient occlusion and normal mapping, which enriched the visual quality of the scene. I also introduced realistic lighting setups, including global illumination and reflective surfaces, which enhanced the immersive experience and brought the environment to life.
                  Additionally, I incorporated basic animations, such as a rotating fan and a moving chair, to add depth and motion to the scene. These animations not only showcased camera navigation but also highlighted my ability to synchronize motion within a 3D space. I went on to implement interactive elements and control logic to give users a more engaging experience and to demonstrate my grasp of real-time user interaction within a graphical application.
                  Through this enhancement, I demonstrated several critical skills aligned with course outcomes, including the ability to create detailed and accurate 3D models, apply realistic lighting and texturing techniques, and implement interactive and animated components. These efforts reflected my proficiency in computational graphics and my capability to use industry-standard tools like Blender to create visually compelling and technically robust 3D environments. </p>

              <h4>Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structures</h4>

               
              <p> My selected CS 320 project aligned with Category Two: Algorithms and Data Structures by utilizing data structures such as classes and services, which were essential to the development and maintenance of backend services for mobile applications. I created and deployed services including ContactService, TaskService, and AppointmentService, each responsible for managing its respective entities (contacts, tasks, appointments) using well-structured data types. These services demonstrated the manipulation of data structures through operations such as addition, modification, and deletion.
                  The methods used to manage these objects were rigorously tested using JUnit, ensuring the accuracy and integrity of the data as it was processed across services. These tests confirmed that the algorithms I implemented were functioning correctly, providing reliable and efficient backend operations that met the required standards for functionality and security. The project showcased my ability to design and apply algorithms and data structures in practical, real-world applications.
                  To enhance the project, I refactored the ContactService, TaskService, and AppointmentService classes to utilize hash maps, which allowed for constant time complexity (O(1)) in insertions, deletions, and lookups. This significantly improved performance, especially as data volume increased. I also implemented search algorithms that enabled users to locate records by name or date, improving usability and data access.
                  Additionally, I integrated sorting and filtering algorithms to help users better organize their tasks, contacts, and appointments. For sorting, I used efficient algorithms such as merge sort, and for filtering, I created dynamic filters that allowed users to extract relevant data based on their input. These enhancements not only improved the overall functionality of the system but also demonstrated my deepened understanding of algorithmic efficiency and data structure optimization in a backend development context.    </p>

              <h4>Enhancement Three: Databases</h4> 

              <p>For the database enhancement, I selected my CS 340 project, the Grazioso Salvare Animal Rescue Dashboard. This project involved building a web application dashboard that displayed and filtered animal rescue data stored in MongoDB. I chose MongoDB for its flexibility in handling documents with dynamic schemas, which was essential given the variable nature of the rescue data. I used the pymongo library to perform all necessary CRUD operations, allowing the backend to effectively manage large datasets and serve real-time data to the frontend interface.
                 Throughout the project, I imported data from a CSV file into MongoDB, filtered that data based on user input, and efficiently retrieved and displayed relevant records. These records dynamically updated tables, graphs, and maps on the dashboard, providing users with visual and interactive access to rescue statistics. This project demonstrated my skills in database design, data handling, and integration into a user-facing application, showcasing my ability to build scalable and responsive web solutions using MongoDB and Dash.
                 To enhance this project and align it with advanced database concepts, I integrated MongoDB indexing and aggregation pipelines to improve both performance and functionality. I created indexes on frequently searched fields such as rescue_type and breed, which significantly improved the speed of data retrieval. Additionally, I built and deployed aggregation pipelines to perform complex queries and generate real-time analytics—for example, calculating the number of animals rescued per operation type and identifying common rescue patterns by location or breed.
                 I also implemented a multi-parameter search feature, allowing users to search animals by rescue type, breed, age range, and location. This feature leveraged optimized query logic and MongoDB's powerful aggregation framework to enhance the dashboard’s filtering capabilities. These improvements resulted in faster query performance, better scalability with larger datasets, and a more robust and user-friendly interface overall.
                 This enhancement clearly demonstrated my ability to optimize database performance, implement advanced data retrieval techniques, and deliver a professional, fully functional full-stack application. The project now reflects a deeper understanding of modern database systems and aligns with the course outcomes by integrating real-world database solutions into a production-quality web application.</p>
